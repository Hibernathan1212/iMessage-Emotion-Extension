# Emotion Picker iMessage Extension
This iMessage extension aims to improve communication and expression of emotions and feelings. Originally made for me and my girlfriend to aid in communicating our feelings. 

Based around an "emotion wheel" where you slowly get more specific with emotion and narrow it down. Also features a slider to express how you're feeling out of 100 to get a general idea of how you're feeling. You can also add a small note to reflect on emotions.

Built with Swift and SwiftUI
